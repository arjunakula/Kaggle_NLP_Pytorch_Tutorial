In the past conventional methods like TFIDF/CountVectorizer etc. we used to find features from text by doing a keyword extraction. Some word are more helpful in determining the category of a text than others. But in this method we sort of lost the sequential structure of text. With LSTM and deep learning methods while we are able to take case of the sequence structure we lose the ability to give higher weightage to more important words. \n","**Can we have the best of both worlds?**\n","\n","And the answer is yes. Actually Attention is all you need. In the author's words:\n","\n","> Not all words contribute equally to the representation of the sentence meaning. Hence, we introduce attention mechanism to extract such words that are important to the meaning of the sentence and aggregate the representation of those informative words to form a sentence vector\n","\n","<div style=\"margin-top: 9px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n","<center><img src=\"https://mlwhiz.com/images/birnn attention.png\"  height=\"400\" width=\"700\" ></center>\n","</div>\n","\n","In essense we want to create scores for every word in the text, which are the attention similarity score for a word. \n","\n","To do this we start with a weight matrix(W), a bias vector(b) and a context vector u. All of them will be learned by the optimization algorithm. On this note I would like to highlight something I like a lot about neural networks - If you don't know some params, let the network learn them. We just have to worry about creating architectures and params to tune.\n","\n","Then there are a series of mathematical operations. See the figure for more clarification. We can think of u1 as non linearity on RNN word output. After that v1 is a dot product of u1 with a context vector u raised to an exponentiation. From an intuition viewpoint, the value of v1 will be high if u and u1 are similar. Since we want the sum of scores to be 1, we divide v by the sum of v’s to get the Final Scores,s  \n","\n","These final scores are then multiplied by RNN output for words to weight them according to their importance. After which the outputs are summed and sent through dense layers and softmax for the task of text classification.\n","\n","Check out my [blog post](https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/03/09/deeplearning_architectures_text_classification/) for more information\n"]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"97b92845b85f289ba795c8c8f7117526abe073d0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## IMPORTS "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import random\n","import copy\n","import time\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import gc\n","import re\n","import torch\n","from torchtext import data\n","#import spacy\n","from tqdm import tqdm_notebook, tnrange\n","from tqdm.auto import tqdm\n","\n","tqdm.pandas(desc='Progress')\n","from collections import Counter\n","from textblob import TextBlob\n","from nltk import word_tokenize\n","\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\n","from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pack_padded_sequence, pad_packed_sequence\n","from torch.autograd import Variable\n","from torchtext.data import Example\n","from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n","import torchtext\n","import os \n","\n","from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","\n","# cross validation and metrics\n","from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n","from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n","from torch.optim.optimizer import Optimizer\n","from unidecode import unidecode\n","\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from textblob import TextBlob\n","from multiprocessing import  Pool\n","from functools import partial\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","import torch as t\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9a4ff5590a6f152dc1bec5aeca79aef10218f7de"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Basic Parameters"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["embed_size = 300 # how big is each word vector\n","max_features = 120000 # how many unique words to use (i.e num rows in embedding vector)\n","maxlen = 70 # max number of words in a question to use\n","batch_size = 512 # how many samples to process at once\n","n_epochs = 5 # how many times to iterate over all samples\n","n_splits = 5 # Number of K-fold Splits\n","SEED = 10\n","debug = 0"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["loss_fn = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(reduction='sum')"]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"654cbe3c8a1f2a618a2441afe00df3b4a89e0a58"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Ensure determinism in the results\n","\n","A common headache in this competition is the lack of determinism in the results due to cudnn.
